# Acerola-DirtJam
A terrain generation project (done in Unity) for the Acerola DirtJam.

The base of the project is here: https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Godot-Terrain

The project, at its core, is a carbon copy of the above Godot project, just made to work with Unity. Further deviations are my personal additions to improve the project, as per the Jam's rules.

(didn't fork because this is a refactor of Godot to Unity, I apologise in advance if this is not proper etiquette in this type of scenario)
